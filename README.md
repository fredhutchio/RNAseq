# RNAseq courses

## Description

This RNAseq course collection includes both lecture-type classes focused on concepts
as well as lab-type skills (coding) classes.
These materials are developed by fredhutch.io, 
the data and computational analysis training program at Fred Hutch. 

Sessions of these courses are periodically taught by instructors at Fred Hutch. The materials are also freely available for self-guided, work-at-your-own-pace study.

Information about RNAseq is also available on the [Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/generation/datagen_rnaApproaches/).

## Course materials

These materials are currently in development.
Additional publicly available materials for equivalent courses are described [here](surveyofcourses.md).

Lessons are available for the following courses:
- [Concepts in bulk RNAseq analysis](concepts/): lecture-style course discussing foundational ideas 
- [Bulk RNAseq analysis with Unix and R](skills/): hands-on coding course teaching data analysis using Hutch resources

Please see the links above for course objectives and schedules.

If you have general questions about performing genomic analyses,
please see [our FAQs](https://fredhutchio.github.io/genomics/#faqs).

## For curriculum contributors and instructors

Please see the following resources for more information on:
- [**Teaching**](https://github.com/fredhutchio/instructors) these materials.
[`instructors.md`](instructors.md) includes information for instructors to facilitate teaching each lesson,
including learner profiles that describe the intended audience for these materials.
[`hackmdio.md`](hackio.md) is an archive of the [interactive webpage](https://hackmd.io) used during lessons.
- [**Contributing**](https://github.com/fredhutchio/curriculum_contribution) to lessons.
  - There are separate folders containing teaching materials for the concept and skills course in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fredhutchio/rnaseq).
  - [Concepts](https://github.com/fredhutchio/rnaseq/concepts)
  - [Skills](https://github.com/fredhutchio/rnaseq/skills): Each lessonâ€™s materials are described in R markdown (`.Rmd`) and markdown (`.md`) files.
  The former should be edited to make changes to the material and then knit to create the latter, which are then rendered in GitHub.
