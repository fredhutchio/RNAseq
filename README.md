# RNAseq courses

## Description

This RNAseq course collection includes both lecture-type classes focused on concepts
as well as lab-type skills (coding) classes.
These materials are developed by fredhutch.io, 
the data and computational analysis training program at Fred Hutch. 

Sessions of these courses are periodically taught by instructors at Fred Hutch. The materials are also freely available for self-guided, work-at-your-own-pace study.

Information about RNAseq is also available on the [Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki]((https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/generation/datagen_rnaApproaches/)).

## Course materials

These materials are currently in development.
Documentation related to course development includes:
- [Survey of other RNAseq courses and workflows](surveyofcourses.md)
- [Pre-requisites for skills course](skills/prerequisites.md)
- [Scripts being developed for skills course](skills/scripts/)

Lessons are available for the following courses:
