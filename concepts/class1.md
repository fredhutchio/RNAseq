# Bulk RNAseq analysis
# Class 1: Introduction to RNAseq data and experimental design

## Objectives

This four-class course introduces theory and concepts relevant to
bulk RNAseq analysis for biomedical research,
and is designed for research scientists (lab, clinical, computational) who have no prior experience working with genomic data.
This course requires participants have a general understanding of the central dogma of molecular biology (DNA->RNA->protein),
but assumes no prior experience handling genomic data.
This course does not teach how to perform computational analyses,
and does not have a 
This course, or equivalent background knowledge, 
is a pre- or co-requisite for the [skills course](XXX).

By the end of this course,
you should be able to:
- Identify data types and applications for bulk RNAseq analysis in biomedical research
- Design statistically robust RNAseq experiments
- Choose appropriate analytical approaches for RNAseq data
- Interpret common visualizations and hypothesis tests associated with RNAseq
- Connect data types, experimental design, and analysis methods to appropriately frame research questions and understand technical limitations of RNAseq analyses.

By the end of this lesson,
you should be able to:
- RNAseq workflow
- experimental design
  - replicates, read length, SE vs PE
  - balancing statistical power: number of samples vs sequencing depth; more samples better than deeper sequencing
- data types (mRNA stranded, mRNA non-stranded, rRNA depleted) and technical limitations of each
- quality assessment of data
