# Bulk RNAseq analysis
# Class 4: Contextualizing results, and mods to RNAseq

## Objectives

By the end of this class,
you should be able to:
- GSEA, GOseq, GOrillia, etc
- isoforms & alternative splicing, lincRNAs, SNVs & RNA editing, multiple species (xenografts, viral, etc) 
- other types of RNA-seq: single-cell (sc) RNA-seq, small RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, nascent RNA-seq

## Putting it together

EXERCISE: type of analysis to interpret results (GO)

EXERCISE: want to ask a follow up question, what type of data are appropriate?
