# Bulk RNAseq analysis
# Class 3: Hypothesis and visualization

## Objectives

By the end of this class,
you should be able to:
- Analysis tools: EdgeR, limma voom, DESeq
- visualizing results (MA-plot, volcano plot, heat map)

## Assessing differential expression

FIXME: links to papers describing algorithms,
short summary of differences among approaches,
why prefer one over another?

[edgeR](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/26/1/139/182458)


[limma (voom)](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/43/7/e47/2414268)


[DESeq2](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8)

What is the difference between the three algorithms?

## Visualizing differential expression

FIXME/IMAGES for each:
- what does plot show?
- how is the plot interpreted?
- primary manuscripts and example images

[MA-plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MA_plot)

[volcano plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano_plot_(statistics))
- [Visualization of RNA-Seq results with Volcano Plot](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-viz-with-volcanoplot/tutorial.html)

[heat maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map)
- [Visualization of RNA-Seq results with heatmap2](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-viz-with-heatmap2/tutorial.html)

## Putting it together

EXERCISE: choosing setup for hypothesis testing (distractors are other metadata)

EXERCISE: interpreting volcano plot, MA-plot

EXERCISE: interpreting heat map
