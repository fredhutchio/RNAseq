# Bulk RNAseq analysis
# Class 3: Hypothesis and visualization

## Objectives

By the end of this class,
you should be able to:
- Analysis tools: EdgeR, limma voom, DESeq
- visualizing results (MA-plot, volcano plot, heat map)

## Assessing differential expression

FIXME: links to papers describing algorithms,
short summary of differences among approaches,
why prefer one over another?

edgeR


limma (voom)


DESeq2


## Visualizing differential expression

FIXME/IMAGES for each:
- what does plot show?
- how is the plot interpreted?
- primary manuscripts and example images

MA-plot

volcano plot

heat maps

venn diagrams


## Putting it together

EXERCISE: choosing setup for hypothesis testing (distractors are other metadata)

EXERCISE: interpreting volcano plot, MA-plot

EXERCISE: interpreting heat map
