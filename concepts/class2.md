# Bulk RNAseq analysis
# Class 2: Read mapping and quantification

## Objectives

By the end of this class,
you should be able to:
- read mapping (tools and assessing quality)
- assemblies and annotations (human and mouse)
- gene level vs transcript level
- quantifying gene expression (htseq-count, cufflinks, RSEM)

## Putting it together

EXERCISE: assess quality of mapped data give some images/summary stats

EXERCISE: choose reference genome appropriate for a tricky analysis (data combination?)

EXERCISE: choose whether gene or transcript level is more appropriate, interpreting read quantification?
