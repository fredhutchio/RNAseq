  1. Using GenomicRanges to store and query genomic data
  2. Finding the overlap between two genomic sequences
2. Sequence data analysis
  1. Loading and querying BAM files using Rsamtools
  2. Computing pile up statistics
3. Read Variant Call Format (VCF) Files
  1. Read and extract contents of VCF
  2. Reading varients from VCF

### Software
* R
  * Rsamtools

  * GenomicRanges

## [David Coffey’s RNAseq repository, for an authentic workflow](https://github.com/davidcoffey/RNAseq)

A series of shell and R scripts used to process RNA sequencing data

### Scope
* GitHub repo
* Minimal guidance

### Outline
1. Downloading raw fastq files from the NCBI sequence read archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) or generating your own sequencing files. 
2. Alignment to a reference genome. Unaligned reads may then be aligned to alternative genomes such a pathogen genome.
3. Merging (for multilane samples) and processing
4. Run the resulting bam files can be run through a series of additional analyses such as GATK variant detection and STAR fusion gene detection.
5. Quality control analyses may also be performed on fastq files using FastQC and bam files using RNAseQC.
