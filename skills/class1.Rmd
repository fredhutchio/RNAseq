## Objectives

Welcome to Bulk RNAseq Analysis from fredhutch.io!
This course introduces you the following steps in performing RNAseq analysis:
- project organization and access via Hutch data storage and compute
- data pre-processing and quality assessment
- read mapping and summary to quantify genes/transcripts
- differential gene analysis and visualization

For more information about RNAseq and genomics work, 
please see the resources for [RNA approaches](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/generation/datagen_rnaApproaches) 
in the Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki.

Before proceeding with these training materials,
please ensure you have installed XXX as described [here](http://www.fredhutch.io/software/).

By the end of this class, you should be able to:
- Organize files (data, code, results) associated with genomics projects
- Trim and filter raw genomic data based
- Assess the quality of genomic data

## About the data

Human and mouse data from ENCODE project

FIXME diagram of study design

3x3 comparison of two tissues

Work through mouse materials in class,
human data provided and available for homework and personal exploration

## Overview of workflow

Questions to ask at each step of the analysis?
- Are data organized and formatted appropriately?
- What characteristics of the data type and experimental design need to be considered?
- Are the results reliable, verifiable, and consistent with expectations?

## Project organization, compute environment, and reproducibility

Project-based file management

How genomics projects differ, with data stored separately

connections with Hutch infrastructure
- network drives
- accessing and transferring Unix-stored data from Mac vs Windows

Connections to reproducibility
- record keeping
- helps you in the future
- can potentially help other people as well
