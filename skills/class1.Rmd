## Objectives

Welcome to Bulk RNAseq Analysis from fredhutch.io!
This course introduces you XXX:
XXX. 

For more information about RNAseq and genomics work, 
please see the [RNA approaches](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/generation/datagen_rnaApproaches) 
resources in the Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki.

Before proceeding with these training materials,
please ensure you have installed XXX as described [here](http://www.fredhutch.io/software/).

By the end of this class, you should be able to:
- Organize files (data, code, results) associated with genomics projects
- Trim and filter raw genomic data based
- Assess the quality of genomic data

## Project organization and reproducibility

Project-based file management

How genomics projects differ, with data stored separately

idiosyncratic things about Hutch infrastructure (network drives)

accessing Unix-stored data from Mac vs Windows

Connections to reproducibility
- record keeping
- helps you in the future
- can potentially help other people as well

## About the data

Human and mouse data from ENCODE project

3x3 comparison of two tissues

Work through mouse materials in class,
human data provided and available for homework and personal exploration

## Trimming and filtering data

initial QC

trimming and quality filtering

follow-up QC
