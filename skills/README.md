#  RNAseq: Unix and R

This four-class course introduces software and analysis methods asociated with bulk RNAseq analysis for biomedical research.
These genomics-focused materials are designed for research scientists with minimal prior coding experience who are interested in learning to perform their own analyses,
as well as computationally proficient staff who are interested in learning best practices for working with research software.
The concepts course listed above (or equivalent knowledge) is a pre- or co-requisite for this course.
As this class focuses on applying reproducible computational methods (e.g., computer coding) to interrogate bioinformatics data,
additional pre-requisites include prior experience with both the Unix shell and R statistical programming.
See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) for more information about what concepts and skills should be familiar to you before this course.

By the end of this course,
you should be able to:
- Manage data and organize projects associated with RNAseq experiments
- Recognize and interpret common file formats for genomic data, as well as software appropriate for interacting with such data
- Validate and assess quality of RNAseq data before, during, and after analysis
- Quantify RNAseq data at the gene level
- Create visualizations and test hypotheses

Please see each set of class materials for specific learning objectives.

FIXME: this class doesn't include (developing workflows, Galaxy)

Solutions for exercises can be found in [here](solutions/README.md).

### Prerequisites

### Unix shell

[Introduction to the Unix Shell](https://fredhutchio.github.io/unix_shell_intro/),
or [Unix Crash Course](https://fredhutchio.github.io/unix_shell_intro/crash_course)

### R

[Introduction to R](https://fredhutchio.github.io/r_intro/)

- working in RStudio with RStudio projects, saving work as scripts
- object assignment
- using functions

### Skills schedule 

When taught by an instructor,
each of the four classes is scheduled for two hours.
The HackMD (interactive page used for sharing links and information) for instructor-led courses is [here](FIXME).

1. Introduction to RNAseq data
2. Read mapping and quantification
3. Hypothesis testing
4. Visualization

Each class in this course includes code-along tutorials interspersed with challenge exercises.

**Required software:**

Software used in this course include:
- Unix shell (to access cluster)
- IGV
- Text editor
- R and RStudio and Bioconductor packages (see classes 3 and 4)

If you would like to run analysis on your own computer
(instead of on the cluster),
you will also need:
- fastqc
- cutadapt
- STAR
- subread
